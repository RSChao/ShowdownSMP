# ShowdownSMP
multi-purpose vanilla+ plugin for ShowdownSMP

Though it is my first plugin and therefore code may be a bit junky, it serves several purposes at once. It adds a way to earn hearts by crafting items (and ensureing that they are more or less late-game), being able to have any multiple of 5 between 10 and 30 hearts (20 to 60 health points).

It also adds a very light-weight life system, allowing the player to start at 5 lives and gain up to 10 (this is hardcoded due to the plugin being made mainly for my own server with the same name as the plugin)

It adds several quality of life items, like stackable items that act as potions, a pickaxe that gives you night vision on command, portable totems of bad omen 5 (this was developed before 1.21, works for both trial chambers and village raids), and more!

Lastly, it adds **Custom enchantments without NMS**. The system is done from scratch and, even though it is not 100% complete due to a silly incident, all enchantments except Teleport (i discarded that one anyway) work like a charm! I also managed to add enchantment table and villager implementations before the incident, and of course they will be readded eventually! (files are available outside the src/ folder)
